                    The crack and powder cocaine sentencing disparity was established by the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1986, which created a 100-to-1 ratio between the amounts of crack and powder cocaine required to trigger mandatory minimum sentences. This policy disproportionately impacted Black Americans, who were more likely to use crack cocaine, despite evidence showing similar rates of cocaine usage across racial groups. Over time, reforms like the 2010 Fair Sentencing Act, which reduced the disparity to 18-to-1, and the 2018 First Step Act, which made these changes retroactive, began to address these inequities. The steady decline in sentences since then reflects shifting public attitudes toward rehabilitation over punishment, increased judicial discretion, and ongoing advocacy for fairer drug policies. However, disparities remain, leaving a lasting legacy of racial injustice and mass incarceration..

                    Crack cocaine became more prevalent in poorer, predominantly Black communities during the 1980s and 1990s due to a combination of socioeconomic factors and systemic issues. Economic hardships, including high unemployment and limited access to quality education and job opportunities, disproportionately affected these areas. Historical policies like housing segregation and redlining contributed to concentrated poverty in urban neighborhoods. The lower cost of crack made it more accessible in these low-income communities compared to powder cocaine, which was more common in wealthier, often white, areas. Law enforcement efforts during the “War on Drugs” focused heavily on urban centers, leading to higher arrest and incarceration rates among Black individuals. Media coverage often highlighted the crack epidemic in these communities, influencing public perception and policy. This combination of economic challenges, systemic factors, and targeted law enforcement resulted in crack being more frequently associated with and affecting Black communities over several decades.

                    Some theories propose that the U.S. government played a role in introducing crack cocaine into lower-income, predominantly Black communities during the 1980s. Advocates of this idea often reference the Iran-Contra affair, alleging that certain government agencies were involved in or turned a blind eye to drug trafficking to fund covert operations abroad, such as supporting Contra rebels in Nicaragua. The supposed motivation behind this alleged involvement might have been to generate untraceable funds for these operations or to destabilize and control urban populations within the United States.

Cocaine is a powerful stimulant that affects the central nervous system, leading to short-term effects such as increased alertness, euphoria, and heightened energy. Both cocaine and crack cocaine share the same active compound and are chemically very similar. According to Oxford, the difference between the two substances is that crack cocaine has the hydrochloride salt removed; hydrochloride salt has no psychoactive effects. This removal results in a form that can be smoked, which delivers the drug rapidly to the brain and can produce a more intense but shorter-lasting high. Regardless of the form, cocaine use carries significant risks, including cardiovascular problems, addiction, and mental health issues like anxiety and paranoia.

                    In conclusion, reducing sentencing disparities for cocaine offenses represents a step toward a more equitable legal system. Recognizing that the substances are similar addresses long-standing biases and seeks to ensure that punishment is proportionate to the crime. As Professor Brown of UNSW SYDNEY states, “The severity of punishment, known as marginal deterrence, has no real deterrent effect, or the effect of reducing recidivism.” This shift acknowledges that harsher punishments may not effectively deter crime or prevent re-offending. Implementing these changes aims to promote fairness and support more effective rehabilitation strategies, potentially benefiting individuals and communities.
