                    In the late 1980s, Hamedah Hasan, a mother seeking to escape an abusive relationship, moved from Portland, Oregon, to Nebraska to live with relatives. Unbeknownst to her, her cousins were involved in drug trafficking. Occasionally, she assisted them by wiring money. When authorities dismantled the operation, Hasan was arrested and, despite her limited involvement, received a 27-year prison sentence—longer than the ringleaders—because she lacked information to negotiate a reduced sentence. Her case underscores the severe consequences of mandatory sentencing laws and the disparities in crack cocaine sentencing. (Wikipedia)

The sentencing disparities between crack and powder cocaine have led to significant societal impacts. Historically, offenses involving crack cocaine, more prevalent in Black communities, resulted in harsher penalties compared to powder cocaine offenses, which were more common among white users. This imbalance has contributed to higher incarceration rates among Black individuals, disrupting families and communities. Efforts to address these disparities include legislative changes and advocacy for fairer sentencing practices.

                    Between 1986 and 2010, the sentencing disparity between crack and powder cocaine was 100-to-1. This meant that possessing 5 grams of crack cocaine triggered the same mandatory minimum sentence as possessing 500 grams of powder cocaine. By the early 2000s, over 80% of those sentenced for crack-related offenses were Black, despite evidence showing that most crack users were white or Hispanic.

Summary

The sentencing disparity created significant racial inequities. Black individuals were far more likely to be arrested and sentenced for crack cocaine offenses, even though usage rates among racial groups were relatively similar. These disparities contributed to a growing racial imbalance in federal prisons. Efforts like the Fair Sentencing Act of 2010 reduced the disparity to 18-to-1, but significant gaps remain in how the judicial system handles drug-related offenses across racial lines. This section examines these trends and their lasting impact on communities.
