                    The sentencing disparities between crack and powder cocaine have led to significant societal impacts. Historically, offenses involving crack cocaine, more prevalent in Black communities, resulted in harsher penalties compared to powder cocaine offenses, which were more common among white users. Efforts to address these disparities include legislative changes and advocacy for fairer sentencing practices.

                    Between 1986 and 2010, the sentencing disparity between crack and powder cocaine was 100-to-1. This meant that possessing 5 grams of crack cocaine triggered the same mandatory minimum sentence as 500 grams of powder cocaine. These disparities contributed to a racial imbalance in federal prisons.

                    Addressing sentencing disparities requires systemic reforms to ensure fairness. Progress has been made, but the lingering effects of these policies highlight the need for continued advocacy and equitable policies in the future.
